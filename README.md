Berliner Spargel Operating System
====

"Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut, aber es ist Spargel zeit!"

BSOS is a minimal operating system for x86's 16-bit Real Mode by
Travis Goodspeed.  It was written in Spargel zeit of 2012 in Berlin,
Germany to pass the time on public transportation.  (Traditional forms
of entertainment such as busking and submitting to random bag searches
were considerably less fun.)

As BSOS contains nothing but a hex viewer and some simple I/O
routines, it's only useful for folks who need to get a 16-bit target
environment running immediately and for whatever reason won't run DOS.
